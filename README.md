Machine Learning–based IDS using Random Forest and NSL-KDD dataset

# 🔐 Machine Learning–Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project implements a **Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to classify **normal and malicious network traffic** using supervised learning techniques.  
The system is designed with a **modular, deployment-ready architecture**, suitable for future real-time SOC-level intrusion detection.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional security mechanisms often fail to detect sophisticated or unknown attacks in time.  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning can enhance network intrusion detection** by learning patterns from historical traffic data and classifying malicious behavior effectively.
